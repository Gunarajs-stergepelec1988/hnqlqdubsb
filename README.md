hey man, i just walked out of Becoming Led Zeppelin and my head's spinning— like, in that buzzing way where u can almost feel music in your teeth, y'know? screens still fading out like when you close your eyes too hard. that theater was a packed mess, rustling popcorn bags and someone's phone bleeped right when it was gettin' deep. argghhh! the seats would've killed my back for real if Page's guitar riffs hadn't numbed it.

honestly, the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮's like a runaway train wrapped in a surreal daydream. they start with this kaleidoscope of their early gigs and its like no time to catch breath. you gotta love bonham pounding drums like a kid demanding dessert before supper (haha, yeah, that's my life on repeat).

was just thinking, how do u even 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   after you’ve 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 it? they make you wanna keep replaying that moment when plant's voice hits like a rogue wave. almost had popcorn stuck in my throat when they rolled thru stairway footage. thought i'd choke and nobody would've noticed over the chorus of misfit spongy seat sounds.

> man, the way they stitched those jams, it’s like weaving the fave bits of daydreams you prolly had on a sugar high while reminiscing about floating schools of fish? (my brain, i swear). every crunch of almond m&m's felt like another piece of their jigsaw coming together just for me.

tbh,  's kind of like an endless riff. tAkes you back to when dad used to blast Kashmir whole Saturdays. kinda wanna call him and just say, we 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 it anyway. maybe u could tell Jimi it wasn't bout him this time.

𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   if you got time tho, the way they painted the 70’s... it's more authentic than trying to taxidermy emotions (ok that's weird, forget i said that).

still, pacing outside, the night grips like a cold fretboard, leaving tunes ringing in the air... right, john paul jones' smile at that one part — like he'd sprouted behind the keys of a magic forest. just. nuts.

um... ok, v random but here's this thing:

```csharp
public void MeaninglessFunction()
{
    int undefinedVariable == null;
    for each thingamajig in the jellybean
    {
        Print(Why am I here?);
    }
}

```
anyway, let me know when u wanna chat about this mess of a night's waves, gotta set my head straight first.
